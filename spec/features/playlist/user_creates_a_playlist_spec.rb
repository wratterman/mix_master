# As a user
# Given that songs and artists exist in the database
# When I visit the plaists path
# And I click "New playlist"
# And I fill in a name
# And I select the songs for the playlist
# And I click "Create Playlist"
# Then I see the playlist title
# And I see the titles of all songs in that playlist
